evolve-juntas
=============

An evolution based algorithm that scalably (w.r.t. the total number of variables) learns the relevant variables of
k-juntas given a membership query oracle when k is small

To use, simply download `evolvejuntas.py` and start up the python or ipython in the same directory. Then follow the
instructions in [this tutorial](http://s3.amazonaws.com/burjorjee/www/evolvejuntas_tutorial.slides.html)

The script depends on `numpy `. Also, `matplotlib` for visualization. These can be installed as follows:

    sudo easy_install numpy
    sudo easy_install matplotlib
